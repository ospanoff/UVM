function [state,options,optchanged] = gaoutputfcn(options,state,flag)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% GAOUTPUTFCN is designed to store information used in plotting tools.
%
% If you specify this as the custom output function, then this function is automatically 
% called from the GAtoolbox every iteration, to maintain running statistics
% for later output/plotting.  Then, after the end of the run, you can call
% this function once more from the command window WITH NO INPUT ARGUMENTS, to retrieve the
% generational statistics, as follows:
%   >> history = gaoutputfcn; % do NOT provide any input arguments
%
% 
% OPTIONAL INPUT ARGUMENTS (USED WHEN CALLED FROM WITHIN GA TOOLBOX):
%   OPTIONS: A structure containing the current GA toolbox options
%   STATE: A structure containing information about the current generation
%   of the optimization:
%             Population: Population in the current generation
%                  Score: Scores of the current population
%             Generation: Current generation number
%              StartTime: Time when GA started 
%               StopFlag: String containing the reason for stopping
%              Selection: Indices of individuals selected for elite,
%                         crossover and mutation
%            Expectation: Expectation for selection of individuals
%                   Best: Vector containing the best score in each generation
%        LastImprovement: Generation at which the last improvement in
%                         fitness value occurred
%    LastImprovementTime: Time at which last improvement occurred
%
%   FLAG: Current state in which OutPutFcn is called. Possible values are:
%         init: initialization state 
%         iter: iteration state
%         done: final state
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS, WHEN CALLED WITH INPUT ARGUMENTS (FROM WITHIN GA TOOLBOX):
%   OPTIONS and STATE are returned unchanged
%   OPTCHANGED is always false.
%   (NOTE: these output arguments are required for compatibility with the
%   toolbox, even though we know we are never changing them inside this
%   function)
% 
% OUTPUT ARGUMENT, WHEN CALLED WITHOUT INPUT ARGUMENTS (I.E., AFTER TERMINATION OF GA RUN):
%   STATE: Structure containing information about the state of the
%          optimization with respect to each generation, with each row 
%          corresponding to a generation; here, 
%               m is the maximum number of generations specified (if terminated before
%                   then by another stopping criteria, data structures are padded
%                   with NaN flags)
%               n is the number of decision variables in each individual
%
%          .BestScore - mx1: fitness of the best individuals
%          .BestIndividual - mxn: rows are the best individuals
%          .WorstScore - mx1: fitness of the worst individuals
%          .WorstIndividual - mxn: rows are the worst indiviuals
%          .AvgScore - mean population fitness
%          .StandardDev - standard deviation of fitness
%          .Distance - average distance between individuals at each
%               generation. Works by randomly selecting 2 sets of 10 individuals from the
%               population and finding the distance between these individuals in
%               vector space. These distances are then averaged over 10 samples.
%          .LastImprovement: Generation at which the last improvement in
%                         fitness value occurred
